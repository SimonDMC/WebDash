(In case the video above doesn't work, the demo
can also be found [here](https://youtu.be/Zq_1JqmAYXU).)

## Usage

Once you install the plugin, run `/webdash link` to open
the dashboard.

Add buttons either through the dashboard or by using
`/webdash add <name> /<command>`.

To view the full list of available subcommands, run
`/webdash help`.

For a more comprehensive showcase of the plugin you can watch
[this video](https://youtu.be/JAiR_sqH2bQ).

### Installing as a PWA

Except for HTTPS, WebDash is fully PWA-compliant, which
means you can add the website as an application on your
phone/computer.

To do so in Chrome, follow these steps:

1. Open the dashboard using `/webdash link`
2. Click the three dots in the top right corner
3. Click More tools
4. Click Create shortcut
5. Enable Open as window (and rename the app if desired)
6. Click Create

The application should now be on your desktop, and you can
open it from there without using `/webdash link`.

## Issues

If you encounter an issue with WebDash, first try restarting
your server, and if that doesn't help, open an issue in this
repository or join my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/mG3QWBp)
for support.

## About Repository

This repository only houses the Java portion of the codebase,
that is the part that runs on the server. The codebase for
the actual dashboard can be found in a separate repository at
https://github.com/SimonDMC/webdash-console.
